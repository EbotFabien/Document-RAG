# Mistral AI Overview

## Mission & Vision
Mistral AI is a European AI company focused on building state-of-the-art open-weight language models. Their mission is to democratize AI access by making high-performing models available to developers, researchers, and companies without restrictive licensing. Mistral emphasizes transparency, efficiency, and scalability in AI development.

## AI Philosophy
- **Open Source First**: Releasing base models (e.g., Mistral 7B) under permissive licenses.
- **Performance with Efficiency**: Designing models with fewer parameters but high performance through optimized training and architectures.
- **Developer-Centric Tools**: Building SDKs and APIs that allow seamless integration of LLMs into products.

## Key Models
1. **Mistral 7B** (2023)
   - 7 billion parameters
   - Decoder-only architecture
   - Trained with grouped-query attention (GQA)
   - Outperforms LLaMA 13B on multiple benchmarks
   - Open-weight and widely adopted

2. **Mixtral 8x7B** (2023)
   - Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture
   - 12.9B active parameters per forward pass
   - 8 experts, only 2 used per token â†’ efficiency with scale
   - Achieves GPT-3.5-level performance with lower inference cost

3. **Mistral Large** (2024)
   - Proprietary model hosted via API
   - Competitive with GPT-4-class models in reasoning and coding tasks
   - Offered commercially for enterprises

## SDK & API Introduction
Mistral provides an SDK (`mistralai`) and REST API to interact with their models.

### Example (Chat Completion)
```python
from mistralai.client import MistralClient

client = MistralClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = client.chat(
    model="mistral-large-latest",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Explain retrieval-augmented generation"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message["content"])
```

### Example (Embeddings)
```python
embedding = client.embeddings(
    model="mistral-embed",
    input="Artificial intelligence transforms industries."
)
print(embedding.data[0].embedding[:10])  # first 10 dimensions
```

## Use Cases
- Knowledge retrieval (RAG systems)
- Summarization of enterprise data
- AI-powered search engines
- Code assistance and debugging
- Customer support chatbots
